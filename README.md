### Continued development

I realized that my CSS skills need to be improve. By going back to tutorials and with the help of so many developer on stackoverflow, I got some useful code which I can apply to my projects. 

### Useful resources

- [FrontEndmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) - Although I did not successfully meet their requirements on CSS but this is the place I seek for projects ideas and they have a great community just like Stackoverflow.

## Future for the project
